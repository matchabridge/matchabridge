## Data Structure

### farms.json
Each farm record includes:
- `id`: Unique identifier
- `name_en` / `name_ja`: Farm names in English/Japanese
- `prefecture_code`: Prefecture location
- `producer_type`: "farm" or "merchant"
- `tea_characteristics`: Array of specialty types
- `products`: Array of product offerings
  - `name_en` / `name_ja`: Product names
  - `grade`: Tea grade (A, B, etc.)
  - `size`: Package size (100g, 1kg, etc.)
  - `image`: Path to product image

Example:
```json
{
  "id": "marukyu-tea",
  "name_en": "Marukyu Tea",
  "prefecture_code": "JP-40",
  "producer_type": "farm",
  "tea_characteristics": ["ceremonial", "shade-grown"],
  "products": [
    {
      "name_en": "Premium Ceremonial Matcha",
      "grade": "A",
      "size": "100g",
      "image": "/assets/products/marukyu-ceremonial.jpg"
    }
  ]
}
```

## Getting Started

### Local Development
```bash
# Using Python's built-in server
python3 -m http.server 8000

# Using Node.js http-server
npx http-server

# Visit http://localhost:8000
```

### Building for Production
1. Ensure all image assets are in `/assets/`
2. Verify CSP headers in server configuration
3. Test on HTTPS (required for full security header enforcement)
4. Configure server to serve from HTTPS with security headers

## Browser Support
- Modern browsers (Chrome, Firefox, Safari, Edge)
- ES6 JavaScript required
- CSS Grid and Flexbox required
- SVG support required for map

## Security Considerations
- CSP headers enforce `'self'` origin policy by default
- External resources whitelisted: Google Fonts, CloudFlare CDN
- No inline scripts used (except for necessary initialization)
- All forms use `form-action 'self'`

### Deployment Headers (Required)
When deploying to production, ensure your server sends these headers:
```
Content-Security-Policy: default-src 'self'; ...
Permissions-Policy: camera=(), microphone=(), geolocation=()
X-Content-Type-Options: nosniff
Referrer-Policy: strict-origin-when-cross-origin
```

## Language Support
### i18n System
- Language detection via URL parameter: `?lang=ja` or `?lang=en`
- Default: English
- Stored in `window.translations` object (utilities.js)
- Dynamic language switching via language toggle link
